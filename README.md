This repository provides multiple Python scripts for automating the process of finding company addresses based on company names. It offers four different methods, each using distinct libraries and APIs, to suit different use cases and preferences.

#Methods Included:

(Method 1):Web Scraping Google Search - This method uses the requests library to perform Google searches and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract addresses from the search results. While it works, it may be less reliable due to potential web page structure changes and web scraping limitations.

(Method 2):Google Maps JavaScript API - This method utilizes the Google Maps Geocoding API through the gmaps Python library to obtain company addresses. It offers a more robust and reliable solution, ideal for projects requiring accurate address information.

(Method 3):Geopy Library with GoogleV3 Geocoder - Method 3 employs the geopy library with the GoogleV3 geocoder to find company addresses. Similar to Method 2, it is a dependable and efficient geocoding solution.

(Method 4): Google Maps Place Text Search API - This method uses the Google Maps Place Text Search API to search for company addresses based on company names. It's another reliable option, with the advantage of potentially reducing the number of API calls for large datasets.
Usage:

#Choose the method that best suits your needs.

Provide your own Google Maps API key for accurate geocoding (replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the code).
Ensure that you have the required libraries installed (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup, openpyxl, gmaps, geopy).
Prepare an input file with a list of company names (e.g., company_names.xlsx or Asia 891.csv).
Explore these methods to streamline your company address lookup tasks and enhance the accuracy of your data.

Note: Always follow API usage guidelines and terms of service when working with external services like Google Maps APIs.
